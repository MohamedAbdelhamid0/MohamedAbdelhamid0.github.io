<h1>RollJam Attack Explained</h1>

<h1>What Is a <b>RollJam</b> Attack?</h1>
<p>A <b>RollJam attack</b> is a radio-frequency relay technique that targets cars and devices that use remote keyless entry systems. Instead of breaking encryption, RollJam captures the code the keyfob sends when a user presses a button, then prevents the car from receiving it. This allows an attacker to store one unused, valid rolling code to unlock the car once.</p>

<h1>Is This Attack Still Possible?</h1>

<h2>Old Cars vs Modern Cars</h2>

<h3>Old Cars</h3>
<p>Older cars used fixed codes. The unlock button always transmitted the same binary sequence. If an attacker captured these codes once, they could replay them indefinitely because the codes never changed.</p>

<h3>Modern Cars</h3>
<p>Modern keyfobs use rolling codes so that each press generates a new code from a synchronized sequence shared between the keyfob and the vehicle. This prevents simple replay attacks because the car invalidates each code immediately after use. However, if a jammer prevents the car from receiving the code, the captured code remains valid.</p>

<h2>How Modern Cars Still Get Attacked</h2>
<p>If a jammer is placed near the car and the victim presses unlock, the attacker can capture the code while blocking it from the vehicle. Since the car never receives it, the code is still valid and can be used later.</p>

<h3>Can This Method Be Patched?</h3>
<p>Rolling codes follow an ordered sequence. If the car and keyfob are aligned on code 0110 and the attacker blocks the next code 0111, the attacker now holds that stored code. But if the user later presses the button again and the car receives the next value 1000, the car resynchronizes and invalidates all previous codes, including the one captured by the attacker.</p>
