            <h1>What is a <span class="highlight">RollJam Attack?</span></h1>
            <p>A RollJam attack is a method used to exploit vulnerabilities in keyless entry systems for vehicles. The attack involves capturing the radio frequency signals sent by a remote key fob when the owner attempts to lock or unlock their car.</p>

            <h1>Is This Attack Still Possible?</h1>
            <p>There are two primary variants of this attack, which differ based on vehicle age and security implementation.</p>

            <h2>Old Cars vs. Modern Cars</h2>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Older Vehicles (Approximately pre-2015-2020)</h3>
                <p>Older vehicles typically used static, unchanging codes for their keyless entry systems. For example, the unlock code might be fixed as "0010110" and the lock code as "0010101".</p>
                <p>This implementation creates a significant security vulnerability. If an attacker captures these codes using a device like a Flipper Zero, they gain permanent access to the vehicle. The captured codes remain valid indefinitely, allowing unlimited unauthorized access.</p>
                <p class="conclusion">This vulnerability prompted manufacturers to develop more secure solutions for modern vehicles.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Modern Vehicles</h3>
                <p>Modern vehicles employ <span class="highlight">rolling code</span> technology to enhance security. This system uses an extensive sequence of codes shared between the key fob and vehicle receiver.</p>
                <p>When a user presses the unlock button, the fob transmits a specific code (e.g., "0101101"). The vehicle validates this code, performs the requested action, and then removes that specific code from its accepted sequence. If the same code is transmitted again, the vehicle will reject it as invalid.</p>
                <p>This security measure effectively prevents simple code capture attacks. However, as with any security system, determined attackers have identified potential vulnerabilities.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="vulnerability-section">
            <h2>How Modern Cars Remain Vulnerable</h2>
            <p>Although the static code vulnerability has been addressed in modern vehicles, a sophisticated attack method known as RollJam can still compromise rolling code systems.</p>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>The RollJam Attack Vector</h3>
                <p>This attack exploits the synchronization mechanism between the key fob and vehicle:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An attacker places a signal jammer near the vehicle</li>
                    <li>When the owner attempts to unlock their car, the jammer blocks the signal from reaching the vehicle</li>
                    <li>Simultaneously, the attacker captures the transmitted code</li>
                    <li>The vehicle never receives the valid code, so it remains in the accepted code sequence</li>
                    <li>The attacker now possesses a <span class="highlight">valid unlock code</span> that the vehicle will accept</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="mitigation-section">
            <h2>Can This Vulnerability Be Patched?</h2>
            <p>While no security system is completely invulnerable, manufacturers have implemented countermeasures to reduce this risk.</p>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Code Synchronization Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Rolling code systems maintain synchronization through sequential code generation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the current valid code is "011010110", the next code will be "011010111"</li>
                    <li>Both the vehicle and key fob track this sequence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a RollJam scenario:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The vehicle and key fob are synchronized at code "0110"</li>
                    <li>An attacker jams the signal when the user transmits code "0111"</li>
                    <li>The vehicle never receives "0111", so it remains at code "0110"</li>
                    <li>The key fob advances to code "1000"</li>
                    <li>If the user presses the button again, transmitting "1000", the vehicle will synchronize to this new code</li>
                    <li>All previous codes, including the captured "0111", become invalid</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This synchronization mechanism limits the attacker to a single use of any captured code, significantly reducing the attack's effectiveness.</p>
